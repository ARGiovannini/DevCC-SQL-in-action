# DevCC-SQL-in-action

<!-- The SQL in action project certainly helped me to better understand how to run SQL queries, and understand the basiscs of what kind of information I can look for.
When doing the queries asked of me by the project, I didn't feel as though I got a better understanding of what makes a succesful airbnb in new york.
After looking at the data a little longer, it seems that having a lower price is one of the biggest predictors of the success of your airbnb, which makes sense based on my knowledge of capitalism. However, other factors certainly involve the location, as well as the type of rental that you are offering. -->
